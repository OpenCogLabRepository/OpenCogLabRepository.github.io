This PsychoPy implementation of the Multi-source Interference Task (MSIT) conforms to the implementation described in Bush and Shin, 2006.

The MSIT was developed as an all-purpose task to provide robust single-participant level activation of cognitive control and attentional regions in the brain (Bush and Shin, 2006). Early work with the MSIT suggests robust activation of regions associated with top-down control â€“ regions that are often active when the DMN is inactive.

See the [repository README](https://github.com/ccraddock/msit) for more information.
