This PsychoPy implementation of the Multi-source Interference Task (MSIT) conforms to the implementation described in:

Bush, G, Shin, LM (2006). The Multi-Source Interference Task: an fMRI task that reliably activates the cingulo-frontal-parietal cognitive/attention network. Nat Protoc, 1, 1:308-13. PMID: 17406250.

To use this task you must install PsychoPy which can be installed as either a python library, or standalone.

The code can be executed by loading and running "MSIT.py" in PsychoPy. The task can work with a keyboard or a Lumina button box. It can be started by either pressing any key on the keyboard or by a trigger sent through the Lumina box (for use during an fMRI).
